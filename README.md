# deep-learning-facemask
Tensorflow Keras and OpenCV to train neural network and detect mask or not with a live camera

Repo contains two parts:
- train and create the model file to be used later
- live webcam camera to detect a face and give confidence factor if a mask is there or not

All has been running successfully on MacOS Monterey with Apple M1 (GPU used OK)
